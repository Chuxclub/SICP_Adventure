In bash:
scheme < my_scheme_code_file.scm

Note: In bash, > is an output redirection, >> is output redirection + append (no overwrite) and
< is an input redirection (my_scheme_code_file.scm > scheme wouldn't work because it was easier
and maybe easier to tell bash that > is always an output redirection than to say that if a file
is before a command then it should be an input redirection...)
